# Tinderbot

The purpose of this project is two-fold:

1. Can we harness the power of online dating to land me a job?
2. Can I find a statistically significant insight on Tinder users based on a certain variable? Ex. Location or age.

I plan on using a Python based and Selenium driven script to automate the swiping portion of Tinder, all the while creatively promoting myself on the job market and webscraping the user profile data of everyone that I come across.

I will use a AWS RDS to host a Postgres database to hold all the information gathered for later analysis.

Right off the bat, I'd like to calculate some fun stats such as:
1. How many users have emojis in their profile
2. Is there a dominant occupation that Tinder users share
3. How many users promote their Instagram or Snapchat accounts
4. How many users ask for Cash App or Venmo payments in their profile

But later on, I'd like to do further NLP text analysis on their description and apply clustering methods on the dataset once I gather a large enough sample size.
